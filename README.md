# CS230_ProjectSoftwareDesign_TheGamingRoom

The Gaming Room has an Android-based game app called Draw It or Lose It. They want to expand this game into a web-based application so it can run across multiple operating systems. It needs to allow multiple teams and users, ensure only one instance of the game runs at a time, and be scalable.

In the documentation, I think I did the best in the recommendations and system architure analysis because I provided clear explanations why Linux would be the best operating platform for their application. 

The design document created a great opportunity to map out the requirements for the application. It is helpful to have a comprehensive understanding of what the application needs so that the code can reflect the solution a hundred percent. The design docuemnt also provides a great way to create a checklist to make sure the code works as intended and has all the requirements taken care of.

I think if I were to revise any part, I would do even more research on the security section to provide a more comprehensive answer.

I interpreted the user's needs by reading carefully the requirements for the application and considering what a user would require on the client side. It's important to consider the user because if the app is not intuitive or has errors, a user is likely to abandon it quickly.

I approached designing the software by considering the requirements, mapping them out, and breaking them down into their functional components. This is important in object-oriented design.
